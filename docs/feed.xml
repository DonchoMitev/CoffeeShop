        Good news for heavy coffee drinkers
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;read-more-state&quot; id=&quot;post-4&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;read-more-wrap&quot;&gt;The scientists found that, as predicted, coffee drinkers had a lower risk of&lt;span
            class=&quot;read-more-target&quot;&gt; death over the course of the follow-up. They also found that this reduction in risk extended to people who drank eight or more cups each day.

It also affected people who metabolize caffeine slower or faster than normal, and it worked across all coffee types (although the benefits were slightly less pronounced for instant coffee).

The fact that individuals who process caffeine differently and those who drink decaffeinated coffee also saw benefits hints that caffeine is not the main player in this beneficial relationship. Coffee consists of hundreds of different chemicals, making this a tricky code to crack.

One group of chemicals that scientists have been interested in is polyphenols, which are found in reduced levels in instant coffee. Much more work will be needed to understand how they fit into the bigger picture, though.

The new study is based on observational data, but because of the large number of participants used, the authors conclude:

&quot;[T]hese results provide further evidence that coffee drinking can be part of a healthy diet and may provide reassurance to those who drink coffee and enjoy it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

        Coffee Is Good For You
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;read-more-state&quot; id=&quot;post-3&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;read-more-wrap&quot;&gt;New research suggests that people who drink two to three cups of coffee a day—&lt;span
            class=&quot;read-more-target&quot;&gt; caffeinated or not—may have a lower chance of dying from certain illnesses than those who abstain.

The study, thought to be the largest of its kind, followed more than 500,000 people in 10 European countries over the course of 16 years. It found that compared with those who don’t drink coffee, those who do show signs of having healthier livers and circulatory systems, as well as lower levels of inflammation, says epidemiologist and study leader Marc Gunter. The findings also indicated that “higher coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death from any cause,” including circulatory diseases and digestive diseases, says Gunter, who heads the nutrition and metabolism section of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.&lt;/span&gt;
